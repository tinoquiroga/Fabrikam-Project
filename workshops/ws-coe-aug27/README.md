## 🏗️ What You're Building: Fabrikam Modular Homes

**A comprehensive business simulation platform for AI demonstrations and real-world scenario training.**

This project simulates **Fabrikam**, a fictional modular home builder, with realistic business operations that translate directly to customer scenarios. You'll build and deploy a complete business platform with AI integration in under 45 minutes.

### 🎯 **Business Value Demonstration**

This fast, easy-to-deploy project showcases the business value of:
- **AI Agents**: Natural language business intelligence queries
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Seamless AI integration with business systems  
- **Modern Cloud Architecture**: Scalable, secure, production-ready deployment
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live business dashboards and reporting

### 🏗️ **System Architecture**
